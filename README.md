This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to implicit type coercion.  The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers and return a number. However, the code calls `add` with a string and a number.  TypeScript's type system doesn't catch this error during compilation, leading to a runtime error. This example highlights the importance of careful input validation and awareness of implicit type coercion in JavaScript and TypeScript. The solution demonstrates how to add runtime checks to improve type safety.
